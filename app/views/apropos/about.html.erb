        <p>
          Every man has an influx of deep rooted, philosophical thoughts which intuition and subconscious together, cause it to rise to the surface.
          These thoughts of the inner mind are generally always lost because they are fleeting. Losing these thoughts are like losing integral parts
          of yourself.<br>
          Hence Mental Constructs was conceptualized. Further on, we had an "epiphany" that just random thoughts recorded are worth just as much
          as no thoughts at all. Categorization is the essence of excellence in this age when information has become power. Thus levels of categorization
          had to be included into Mental Constructs.<br>
          Every thought that we are capable of conjuring, should not be left at a premature, under developed level. Coming up with a brain wave or
          epiphany is just the beginning. It has no worth if further deliberation and thought is not put into it. These thoughts must be
          "constructed" (Hence Constructs) to a level where full clarity of the concept is achieved.
