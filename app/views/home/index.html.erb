                Every man has an influx of deep rooted, philosophical thoughts which intuition and subconscious together, cause
                it to rise to the surface. These thoughts of the inner<br> mind are generally always lost because they are fleeting.
                Losing these thoughts<br> are like losing integral parts of yourself. <br>Record Them.<br><br>
              Here is a tool which allows you to do so.<br><br>

          <h2>Welcome to Mental Constructs </h2>
          <p>Man has the ability to think. That is why you are not a monkey. You can think.</p>
          <p>Most of the times your mental-construct is lost. Here you can record them and organize them. Exhibit your Mental Constructs to others for judgements, ideas and of course, for General Consent (Don't worry, we all do it).</p>

          <p>We are all God's disciples, we exist so that our soul can attain enlightenment through experience. Experience builds thinking capacity, which a man can use to understand about life, the universe and everything (42, right?). There is so much in this world you do not know and there is so much in this world you cannot understand (women!!!).
            Reading makes a ready man, Writing a perfect man! Just reading is not sufficient (though very important). Writing makes a perfect man because you think again on what you have read and what you have thought. Thinking opens up new vistas which you never before could have imagined.
            The more you can think the closer you are to enlightenment and God.</p>

          <p>So, THINK!!!</p>

            <h3>Create and Organize Your Creative Constructs</h3>
            <p>Thoughts materialize but are rarely recorded by us. Even rarer do we deliberate on them and upgrade them. Here you can write entire constructs in a powerful editor, store them and keep on upgrading them. Any Creative Constructs or thoughts can be stored indefinitely. Never lose your thoughts again. When thoughts become too many, you can organize them proficiently. Categorize your thoughts according to your preferences, view them at will and upgrade.</p>

            <h3>Exhibit Your Constructs</h3>
            <p>You can share your Constructs with other thinkers, to get their opinions and comments. You can view other Exhibits and admire and bookmark them.</p>

            <h3>Record Your Epiphanies, Brainwaves and Factoids</h3>
            <p>Cognition is the mental action or process of acquiring knowledge and understanding through thought, experience, and deliberation. Cognitions are acquired through perception, sensation or intuition. These realizations generally result in the most innovative, intriguing and fascinating thoughts. Cognition is any form of cognitive activity. MentalConstructs has narrowed down "Cognitions" into 3 major subcategories. Epiphanies, BrainWaves and Factoids.</p>
